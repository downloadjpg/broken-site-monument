## Welcome to my page, I'm Brody.

Hello, I'm Brodric (Brody), a passionate CS student with a deep love for creating efficient, elegant, and above all, practical applications. My primary focus stems from video games, including graphics rendering, behavioral and learned A.I., as well as physics simulations. Additionally, my studies in math have given me plenty of experience with linear algebra, signal processing, and more.
